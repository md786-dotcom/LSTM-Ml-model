cd LSTM-Ml-model
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download model files:
   - Download the trained model files from the Kaggle notebook output:
     - `stock_price_lstm_model.h5`
     - `scaler_features.pkl`
     - `scaler_target.pkl`
   - Place these files in the project root directory

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5001`

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t stock-prediction-bot .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5001:5001 stock-prediction-bot
```

## üìä Model Details

### Architecture
- **Input Layer**: 60 timesteps, 13 features
- **LSTM Layers**: 3 layers (128, 64, 32 units) with dropout
- **Dense Layers**: 2 layers (64, 32 units)
- **Output Layer**: 5 predictions (next 5 days)

### Features Used
- OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
- Technical indicators:
  - Moving Averages (5, 20, 50 days)
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - Volatility
  - Price ratios

### Training Data
The model was trained on historical stock market data from NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT exchanges.

## üöÄ Deployment on Paperspace Gradient

See [paperspace-deployment.md](paperspace-deployment.md) for detailed deployment instructions on Paperspace Gradient Pro.

## üí¨ Usage

1. Type a stock ticker in the chat (e.g., "Predict AAPL")
2. Or click on popular stock buttons
3. Get AI-powered predictions and recommendations

### Example Commands
- "Predict AAPL"
- "What will TSLA do?"
- "Analyze MSFT stock"
